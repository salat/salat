Features new in Salat 1.9.1 include:

- serialize case objects as strings (backward compatible with old type hint serialization)
- shrink your serialized objects by suppressing fields whose value is the same as the default value
- existential typing (pull request #48 from akraievoy)
- BSON Timestamp support (pull request #53 from rajish)
- Maven users rejoice: Salat's Casbah dependency now correctly typed to aggregator pom in generated POMs
