Features new in Salat 1.9.2 include:

- serialize case objects as strings (backwards compatible with old type hint serialization)
- switched from lift-json to [JSON4S][JSON4S]
- various fixes for JSON conversion, including an `Option` that contains a case object
- support for converting `Map[String, _]` to compact rendered JSON
